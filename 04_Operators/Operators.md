### JavaScript Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

1. Declare a variable `a` and set it to `8`.
   Using the arithmetic operators, perform the following operations and print the result for each:

- Add 3 to a.
- Subtract 5 from a.
- Multiply a by 2.
- Divide a by 4.

Find the remainder when `a` is divided by 3.

---

### String Concatenation

Declare two variables, `greeting` and `name`, and set them to `"Hello"` and `"John"` respectively. Concatenate them and print the result.

---

### Exponentiation

Declare a variable `base` and set it to `3`. Use the exponentiation operator to raise it to the `power of 4`. Print the result.

---

### Increment and Decrement

Declare a variable `count` and set it to `5`. Increment it by `1` and then decrement it by `1`. Print the result after each operation.

--

### Assignment Operators

Declare a variable `total` and set it to `15`.
Use the compound assignment operators `+=` to add 8 to total.

- Subtract 5 from total.
- Multiply total by 2.
- Divide total by 4.
- Find the remainder when total is divided by 3.
- Raise total to the power of 2.

Print the result after each operation.

---

### Comparison Operators

Compare the following pairs of values using both == and ===:

- 2 and "2"
- 5 and 5
- "apple" and "orange"
  Print the results for each comparison.

---

### Greater than or Less than

Compare the following pairs of values using the greater than (>) and less than (<) operators:

- 10 and 5
- 5 and 10
- 10 and 10
- 15 and 10

Print the results for each comparison.
