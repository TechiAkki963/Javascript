# Explanation of Stack and Heap

1. Stack

Think of the `Stack` like a tall tower of `blocks`. Each `block`` is a task or job you need to do. When you finish a task, you take the top block off. It's like a to-do list.
Let's say you have a toy box, and each toy is a task. You can only play with the top toy until you put it back. If you add a new toy, it goes on top.
Example:

You want to count to three. You start with `"1"` on the top of the stack. After you say "1," you take it off the top. Now "2" is on top. You say "2" and take it off. Finally, "3" is on top, and you say "3." The stack is empty, and you're done!

2.Heap

Now, think of the `Heap` like a big playground where you can put lots of toys anywhere you want. You can have a pile of toys, and you decide which one to play with.
In the Heap, you have more freedom. You can add toys, take them out, and play with any toy you like.
Example:

You have a box for all your stuffed animals. You can pick any stuffed animal from the box to play with. You can add new ones or take some out. It's a more flexible place to keep your toys.
In computer terms:

The Stack is like your to-do list of tasks, where you do one thing at a time and finish before moving on.
The Heap is like a big playground where you can use things freely, adding or removing them as you need.
